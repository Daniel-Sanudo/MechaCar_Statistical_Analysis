## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

This study is focused on comparing the reliability of MechaCar automobiles with that of their competition by comparing the expense and frequency time of maintenance performed on MechaCar cars and those from other manufacturers.

The hypothesis for this study is the following, cars manufactured by MechaCar automobiles require on average 30% less maintenance in terms of frequency and cost than those from the other manufacturers.

In order to eliminate some regional differences, the sample data will be extracted from the same city so that conditions such as weather, roads and fuel quality remain constant through the dataset and will not require a more in-depth consideration.

The data for this study will be the price of the parts (continuous data) and the frequency at which car owners take their cars to maintenance (interval) for both MechaCar and the competition

Since both of these variables are numerical, a multiple linear regression could be used to estimate the total expense for the owners. 

Moreover, since this information would be categorized between MechaCar and others, it would be possible to use a two-sample t-Test to study the difference in reliability.

Through this study it would be possible to quantify the reliability of MechaCar automobiles and adjust the business plan according to it, be it marketing campaing or offering a better warranty.
